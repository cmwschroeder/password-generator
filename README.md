# password-generator

## Description

This is a password generator that will ask a series of prompts and then generate a new password given the criteria inputted by the user.
The user will be able to determine the length for the new password as long as the length is between 8 and 128 characters long. The user will
then get to decide what types of characters they want in their password, the options being lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and
special characters. They will do this by either confirming the box to select to use that type of character, or canceling the box specifying that the new
password will not contain characters of that type. The user must select at least one character type or the new password will not be generated. This 
password will contain at least one of all the character types that were selected. The new password will then be displayed on the page for the user to 
copy and paste and use whenever they need to.
